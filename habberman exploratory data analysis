#Here we are exploring the haberman dataset
#First of all lets understand the dataset in depth#
#haberman dataset consists of three features namely axillary lymph nodes, age of the patient and year of ssurgery. it has one class variable.
#The class variable is represented as 0 and 1. what does this mean? '0' means the patient died within five years of surgery and '1' means
#the patient survived after five years of surgery.

#Objective of our study#
#The main objective in this dataset is to explore which features/attributes are helpful in determining the survival status of the patient
#after surgery.#
#so to start with lets import the necessary libraries#

#importing the necessary packages
import numpy as np #it does all the numerical calculations
import pandas as pd #it helps in loading our csv dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #this module is used for plotting
import seaborn as sns #this is a high level plotting tool built on top of matplotlib

#load the haberman dataset into pandas dataframe
haberman = pd.read_csv("haberman.csv")

#Now we hae to see how many datapoints and features are there in dataset
print(haberman.shape) #this command gives the number of datapoints and features in the dataset
